# 🧠💭 Philosophers 42 Project | Dining Philosophers 🍝🍴

Welcome to my **Philosophers** project!  
This project has taught me about **multithreading, mutexes, and deadlock prevention** 🍽️.

---

## 📚 What Is This?

In this project, you'll simulate the **Dining Philosophers Problem**, a classic concurrency problem in computer science. Imagine five philosophers 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️ sitting at a round table. Each needs two forks 🍴 to eat spaghetti 🍝 — but there are only five forks!

Sounds simple? Think again.  
This project tackles the big questions of:
- 🤹 How to handle resource sharing?
- ⏱️ How to avoid starvation?
- 💥 How to prevent deadlocks?
- 🧩 How to coordinate threads?

## 🧪 How to Run It

make
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [optional_number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

Example:

./philo 5 800 200 200

"I eat, therefore I am." — Descartes, probably
"To fork or not to fork." — Shakespeare, definitely not
"Concurrency is hard." — You, after this project 😅
